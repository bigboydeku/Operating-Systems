# Operating-Systems
Understanding the lower level concepts of Operating Systems. Each file contains certain portions of the XV6 model, an implementation of UNIX. Specific parts of the code were used from XV6. This is purely for academic use.

## Configuring sh.c
Understanding how an operating system reads in commands given through the GUI.

## System Calls
Multiple Files are needed to implement custom system calls. These system calls work closer with the hardware. The system call created shows certain processes (RUNNABLE, RUNNING, and SLEEPING) currently in the CPU, as well as number of CPUs used.

## Creating stdio.h
This was created to understand the implementation of C language libraries and how they give programs access to certain functions. I have implemented a few types of printing functions.
